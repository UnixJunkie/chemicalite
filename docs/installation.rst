Installation
============

Some experimental conda packages are currently available for the Linux and OSX operating systems.

.. note::
  These packages were built using a conda-forge Miniforge distribution, and require RDKit 2020.09.1 or later. The compatibility and interoperability with the Anaconda  distribution, or with other packages built on top of Anaconda, wasn't tested and it's not assumed.

To install the ChemicaLite extension using conda, just specify the `ric/label/dev` channel, either on the conda command line, or in your `.condarc` file.

For example::

    $ conda install -c ric/label/dev chemicalite
